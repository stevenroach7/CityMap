# CityMap
3D Augmented Reality Data Visualization of Economic City Data



## Installation
This project is developed using Unity but the output is an iOS app that is created from Unity. For demoing of this visualization, we have uploaded a zipped iOS project to dropbox at https://www.dropbox.com/s/mr2gehmezauicv7/CityMap1021.zip?dl=0. We ran into file size issues trying to push it to GitHub. To run the visualization, unzip and open the CityMap1021 iOS project in XCode. Then connect an ARKit compatible apple device to the computer. Devices that can run ARKit include iPhone SE, iPhone 6s and higher, iPad Pro, and iPad 2017 running iOS 11. Press the play button in the upper left corner to install the app onto the device. When the app opens, we recommend waiting a few seconds to let the app get a sense of its surroundings. Then touch the screen to place the map in a convenient location. We recommend a flat surface such as a table or counter top as that is the easiest for ARKit to anchor the map on top of. After the map is well placed, we recommend unchecking the Reposition Map checkbox to anchor the map in place. In rare occurrences, we've found that the installation malfunctions and as a result, the map is purple. Reinstalling the app has fixed this in our experiences. Please feel free to contact us if you have any problems with the installation. Hope you enjoy!
